Here is a brief description of all the functions we have created over in trie.cpp 

createTrieNode :- Creates a trie node and sets it to default values (NULL and 0) (Properly Implemented)

insertTrieNode :- Inserts a trie node with a specified character value and adds freq + 1 if the node isnt new (Properly Implemented)

displayTrie :- displays all words stored in the trie (Properly Implemented)

displayQueryTrie :- displays only those words that are stored after the query string in the trie (Properly Implemented)

suggestWord :- Suggests the words that could be next based on the frequency of the next alphabet (NOT PROPERLY IMPLEMENTED)

printAutoComplete :- this takes the current pointer from the root node to the necessary node from which we will perform suggestWord (Properly Implemented)

AutoCorrect - Corrects a misspelled word that has been entered in the query space (Not Implemented)

searchTrieNode :- Searches for a specific word in the trie (Properly Implemented)

deleteTrieNode :- Deletes a specific word in the trie (Properly Implemented)
