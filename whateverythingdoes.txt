Here is a brief description of all the functions we have created over in trie.cpp 

createTrieNode :- Creates a trie node and sets it to default values (NULL and 0) (Properly Implemented)

insertTrieNode :- Inserts a trie node with a specified character value and adds freq + 1 if the node isnt new (Properly Implemented)

displayTrie :- displays all words stored in the trie (Properly Implemented)

displayQueryTrie :- displays only those words that are stored after the query string in the trie (Properly Implemented)

suggestWord :- Suggests the words that could be next based on the frequency of the next alphabet (NOT PROPERLY IMPLEMENTED)

printAutoComplete :- this takes the current pointer from the root node to the necessary node from which we will perform suggestWord (Properly Implemented)

AutoCorrect - Corrects a misspelled word that has been entered in the query space (Not Implemented)

setup_trie : reads the text corpus and pushes words to the trie

setup_emoji : reads from the emoji.txt file and then puts every emoji into a hashmap

get_emoji : search for the word in the hashmap to find the emoji for it
